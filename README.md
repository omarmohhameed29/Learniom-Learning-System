# Learniom
## Description
Learning management system that helps an **Admin** to manage university,
where the Admin can:
- Add / delete -> Student, Professor, courses and other admins as well
- Search -> through all Student, Professor, courses
- Filter displayed data in Student, Professor, courses <br />
## Designing Stage
before start codind our programm we design different **UML DIAGRAMS** to help visualizing work flow of the programm and the neccessary classes, so we have implemented:
- Use Case Diagram
- Sequence Diagram
- Class Diagram
- Activity Diagram
here on of UMls diagram, Sequence Diagram that shows flow of the program
![Use case diagram copy (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117366528/210100749-cdbd7117-2cde-4955-8fe7-237ae69362d5.png)

## Technology
we implement this project using **c++** programming language and **QT framework** to design responisve UI <br/>
the reason we choose this language is its speed compilation process comparing to other programming languages like python or java, as we need out porject to efficient 
when dealing with big data.<br/>
imagin the Admin want to search through all students data which store data of every single student in the whole university, the process need
to be fast. 
## Work Flow
Admin need to login firs, then the dashboard appears displaying following info:
- Admin info
